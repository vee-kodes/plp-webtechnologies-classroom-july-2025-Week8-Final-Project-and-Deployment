            <h1>About SpendWise</h1>
            <p>Your money should work for you — not the other way around. SpendWise helps you track income, expenses, and savings in a way that’s simple, private, and stress-free.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to give you clarity and confidence. With interactive charts and savings progress trackers, SpendWise makes it easy to understand where your money goes and how to reach your goals faster.</p>
            <p><strong>Why SpendWise?</strong> We created this planner because managing money often feels overwhelming and complicated. We wanted a tool that was powerful but still simple, private, and easy to use. No accounts, no servers — just you and your finances, all in your control.</p>
            <p><em>We believe everyone deserves financial clarity, control, and the confidence to achieve their goals.</em></p>
